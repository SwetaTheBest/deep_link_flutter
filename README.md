# deep_link_flutter

A Flutter project to create deep links with Firebase.

## [Create Dynamic Links in a Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/flutter/create)

You can create short or long Dynamic Links with the Firebase Dynamic Links Builder API. This API accepts either a long Dynamic Link or an object containing Dynamic Link parameters, and returns URLs.

</br>
Set up Firebase and the Dynamic Links SDK
</br>

</br>

1. Install and initialize the Firebase SDKs for Flutter if you haven't already done so.

2. From the root directory of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the Dynamic Links plugin:

        **flutter pub add firebase_dynamic_links**

3. If you're building an Android app, open the Project settings page of the Firebase console and make sure you've specified your SHA-1 signing key. If you use    App Links, also specify your SHA-256 key.

4. In the Firebase console, open the Dynamic Links section.

   If you have not already set up a domain for your Dynamic Links, click the Get Started button and follow the prompts.
